For the second phase of the RCMIP we used the posterior results from the UI mcmc calibration 
of Hector. The scripts here run Hector a total of 90,000 times format these results into 
the submission netcdf format and the meta csv files. 

Scripts 
  * 0.func_format_rcmipII_nc.py - a script provided by Jared Lewis that takes the R defined ncdf4 format and 
      transforms it into the python formatted ncdf4 strucutre. 
  * 1.run_hector_ensemble.R - the script that runs hector 10,000 times for a single scneario
  * 2.post_processing.R - the script that selects the outputs relevant to RCMIP II 
  * 3.create_netcdf_files.R - make the netcdf files
  * 4.create-rcmip-meta_model_information.R / 4.create-rcmip_model_reporeted_metircs.R - create the model meta              files.
  
  
  Instructions : so it is unideal, but due to time constraints, staff allocation, and existing software here 
  we are. 
 
Instructions:  
* For each scenario run scripts 1 and 2 individually for each scenario, note you will need to specify the senario to process. 
* Then source the L3 script, this will produce the pyrcmip netcdf files for all of the scenarios. 
* Run the L4 scripts to prepare the meta data for the project. 

After the final netcdf files are generated you will want to validate them with the rcmip validate command, after 
they pass upload them to rcmip with the upload command.
