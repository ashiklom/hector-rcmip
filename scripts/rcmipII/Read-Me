For the second phase of the RCMIP we used the posterior results from the UI mcmc calibration 
of Hector. The scripts here run Hector a total of 90,000 times format these results into 
the submission netcdf format and the meta csv files. 

Scripts 
  * 1.run_hector_ensemble.R - the script that runs hector 10,000 times for a single scneario
  * 2.post_processing.R - the script that selects the outputs relevant to RCMIP II 
  * 3.create_netcdf_files.R - make the netcdf files
  * 4.create-rcmip-meta_model_information.R / 4.create-rcmip_model_reporeted_metircs.R - create the model meta              files.
  
  
  Instructions : so it is unideal, but due to time constraints, staff allocation, and existing software here 
  we are. 
  
  For each scenario run scripts 1, 2, and 3. Note you will need to specify the senario to process. Note that 
  after the netcdf is made from running script 3, you may need to go back and delete the ensemble of Hector 
  results created by the level 1 script. After all the netcdf files had been made, run the level 4 scripts.
